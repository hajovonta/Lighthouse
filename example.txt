; you should see a web repl where you can type CL commands and see responses.
; type (use ctrl+enter to send commands to CL):

(in-package :cl-beacon)
(defun foo (myvar)
  (gtfl-print 'output (+ 10 (parse-integer myvar))))
(gtfl-textbox "test" "" 'foo)

; you will be presented with a textbox, where you can type numbers (you can implement other type of inputs with validation if you like), type "123" and press ctrl+enter. Your input will be fed by function foo and you will get back the result.

; there is limited error handling. Currently you should often check your CL repl.
